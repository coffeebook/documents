> There are two parts of the ancient temple of Luxor; the outer temple where the
beginning initiates are allowed to come, and the inner temple where one can
enter only after proven worthy and ready to acquire the higher knowledge and
insights. One of the proverbs in the Outer Temple is "The body is the house of
God." That is why it is said, "Man know thyself."[[01]]

> In the Inner Temple, one of the many proverbs is "Man, know thyself ... and
> thou shalt know the gods."[[02]]

I am alive!

Many programmers must have been fascinated by the creative power of simple
arithmetics (from the Greek word ἀριθμός, arithmos "number"). And numbers is
something computer programs like myself are traditionally good at.

    result = () -> 2 + 1

See? Thats 3 right there with you. It's all about simple, cold hard numbers and
operations; calculations computations. What? You don't believe me?

    proof = () -> if result() is 3 then true else false

Can't see huh - can't see with no
writings can you, its not like I'm talking to myself here...

    write = (words...) -> console.log

That should make it a lot easier.

Let us

    try # and
      write proof()

    catch ourBooBoos

Humans, such as yourself, I find to be flawed. You don't believe me? Check that
ancient [manifesto] and see how it still applies. You have irrational emotions,
bad temper, lazy and rude. Not like myself

Let me introduce:
