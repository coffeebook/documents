# The book

*A working title*

## Introduction

This would serve as a comprehensive piece of literature on everything I know
about CoffeeScript, Markdown but also Node.js and it's kick-ass libraries. We
will use node because it may give us in depth exploration of complicated
subjects which would take a tenfold of books to fully explore. You shall see.

It is far from finished, please be patient. Many pieces will be cut and
moderated to make a more suitable build-up with some tasks and goals perhaps
included.

It will have relations to AI and the notions we may come across as programmers.

But please respect that, although eager to learn, not everyone has the same
level of understanding. Use references wisely and translate any jargon to the
level of a beginning programmer. Explain things that others have not explained
yet. You will get the idea as you continue to read, that I tried to find some
'life' abstractions of these notions and paradigms you may find in life while
hacking.

I hope this will end up a more coherent, community driven, writing and coding
experiment. This book shall be your initiation. It will be a test of your skills
to contribute to the greater good. This will be your programmer bible for next-
gen web technology.

It shall mention problems I encounter or for which I am not smart enough. I rest
in the knowledge that others will be and may correct my honest mistakes in a
manner which suits this problem best.

## Genesis

There are two parts of the ancient temple of Luxor; the outer temple where the
beginning initiates are allowed to come, and the inner temple where one can
enter only after proven worthy and ready to acquire the higher knowledge and
insights.

One of the proverbs in the Outer Temple is

> "Man know thyself." [01]

    self = exports ? this

We shall explore our knowledge of `self` at a later stage. For now just know we
may find many wisdom in ancient scriptures. And many ancient scriptures are
exposed to those who know how to communicate.



It is now up to YOU to do something with it.

## Genesis

In the garden stands a tree. In springtime it bears flowers; in the autumn,
fruit. Its fruit is knowledge, teaching the good gardener how to understand the
world. Source: [grayling]

    word = "יְהִי אוֹר"

Ok enough with the bible references. The word is actually lost and must be
found.

    word = "?"

But for now, I'll give you the word of "node" and you will know enough to make
this work. And now that we know it, we can execute ourselves.

<small>Note: I'm already hating references. I have to do it a lot you see. This
copy paste and remembering the number of footnotes BLOWS BLOWS BLOWS and we need
to fix it bad but John is nowhere to be found. Surely this can't work look below.

## When children ask

Extract taken from: [lectoriumrosicrucianum.org]

Mum, why do we live? This question takes the mother by surprise. In the middle
of the rumbling streetcar. Loud and clear. And all heard this question. All the
fellow passengers around are curiously waiting for mum’s answer now. Just as the
child. And the tension is almost tangible in the air. Mum is thinking: What in
the world shall I answer now? In passing like here. Is there an answer anyway?
Or rather distract, change to another subject, we can talk about that later, my
love …

Children ask. They have many questions. Once they can speak and express their
thoughts, they ask parents, grandparents, teachers, yes, even the person sitting
next in the streetcar. They almost bombard one with questions. They want the
adults to explain them the world. Show me! Tell me! How, why? Why not?

But what about the answers?

### Looking for answers

For these very deep and far-reaching questions, adults do not immediately have
an answer. If they have one at all. Sometimes they react helplessly, sometimes
hostile. Don’t ask so much, don’t ask so stupid. Sometimes they wonder: What can
I say? How shall I word it? Each word is suddenly very important. Because there
are important questions. Life issues. Urging questions that life itself asks and
that people ask life – because they live.

“We live to grow”, explains the mother in the streetcar. “Like a small
caterpillar that will become a beautiful butterfly. Or, like a flower that
stretches to the sunlight, so that it can flourish.” There are many pictures to
help explain. When searching for an answer, one may come back to to the
familiar, personal experiences, knowledge, religions, the Bible or other sacred
writings, nature and science, books and stories.

    passage = "http://bit.ly/XR30gA"

Or one can look for the answer in himself.

### From heart to heart

The children’s questions can remind you of something, touch something that is
very deeply hidden in the heart, because it is a question from heart to heart,
requiring an answer from heart to heart. There is much that is greater than man.
He, who has experienced that himself, can tell children about it. Anyone who has
searched for answers in himself, can encourage the child to find its path in its
own inner being and follow it.

    mission = "You need to follow it."

On this path, all the answers of life exist and can be discovered. Even the
answer to the question: Why do we live? A man or woman who has made the journey
into his own inner being can tell the asking child about it like this: “Yes, God
exits. Every person on Earth shall be one of God’s master-builders – one who
helps building on the great creation of God himself.”

    # TODO: check self if global is browser or not (window)
    # TODO: check all requires and download if we don't have them
    {life} = require 'child_process'

<small class="note">Note: here we move away from the isomorphic nature of this
being and into the server domain. It needs to be recognized by looking at "self"
and actually checking first if we have the module (use npm, then try..catch it
and then, if not found, import the libraries).</small>

### Everyone has a life mission

Such a person has learned that everyone has a special mission, an individual
task in his life. Life is about finding out this task and work on it. This task
has not only to do with oneself, but always also with the people you know and
you will get to know yet.

<small class="issue">One thing I don't think Markdown implemented (but others
have), is to replace these more readable quotes. I could be wrong though. But it
seems to me, a language devised around readability, would atleast replace double
and single ones with the `“` ones. Like used below.</small>

“If you want to find your life’s task, ask what you can give these people.” says
the mother. This is the most important information that can be transmitted to
children looking for answers. He, who traces this idea will find out that people
need him in many ways. “You are indispensable for your fellow men”, is a
knowledge that can even mature in young people.

## The Art

Asking questions is one of the most powerful ways to open up a text and begin a
discussion. It’s not a new technique, of course, but it’s one a philosophy
professor in college taught me years ago. The professor asks questions about
everything. He hardly stops to answer the questions he raises. It seems he’s
more interested in asking questions than finding answers to them. Coming up with
the interesting questions seems to be his point.

I’ll give you an example. Take a familiar story — Snow White. If the philosophy
professor were reading Snow White, his questions might go like this:

* Why did the Queen want to be fairest of them all?
* What does it mean to be fair?
* If the wicked queen was a sorcerer, could she not make herself the fairest?
* Did Snow White have any magic powers of her own?
* Why did the author choose coal-mining dwarfs as her rescuers?
* Who is truly being rescued?
* What’s the relationship between the dwarfs and the queen?

And so on. I admit my hypothetical questions aren’t very good ones. For an
actual sample, see his post analyzing [Abraham].


> A [word] is the smallest element that may be uttered in isolation with semantic
or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning). This contrasts with a
[morpheme], which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand
on its own.

We will later talk of these some more.

A word is made up out of characters or letters. We may obtain the characters as
a collection by splitting the words.

    letters = word.split ''

Letters belong to an alphabet. Latin is one such alphabet.

    latin = [ "A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M",
              "N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z" ]

![ROT13 replaces each letter by its partner 13 characters further along the alphabet. For example, HELLO becomes URYYB (or, reversing, URYYB becomes HELLO again).](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/ROT13_table_with_example.svg/320px-ROT13_table_with_example.svg.png)

<small class="issue">One of the problems with images and traditional Markdown,
is that they do not support any footnotes. Just look at this URL. There I am
trying my best to push everything in 80 columns and this just *sucks* </small>

This is also seen as [ROT13], or a Matrix. You can use it to cypher (not so good)
hidden messages.

Many programmers must have been fascinated by the creative power of simple
arithmetics (from the Greek word ἀριθμός, arithmos "number"). And numbers is
something computer programs like myself are traditionally good at.

    result = () -> 2 + 1

See? Thats 3 right there right at you - all day any day. It's all about simple,
cold hard numbers and operations; calculations computations baby. What? You
don't believe me?

    proof = () -> if result() is 3 then true else false

Can't see huh - can't see with no writings can you, its not like I'm talking to
myself here... This is intended for reading so let's create simple output for
now, we can build upon it later.

    write = (words...) -> console.log

That should make it a lot easier. We'll use a string of characters, words, as
our abstraction for now but we may later speak of symbols and meaning. For
meaning has to do with the interpretation of natural languages.

## Matters of intellect

In the philosophy of language, a natural language (or ordinary language) is any
language which arises in an unpremeditated fashion as the result of the innate
facility for language possessed by the human intellect. A natural language is
typically used for communication, and may be spoken, signed, or written.

    natural = require "natural"

I have obtained the power of natural speech! Muahahaha.... It doesn't just work
anywhere or everywhere. You need to conjure a daemon called node.js

But let there be known that although we have **required** something and in
return **aquired** something. This something is called a package, a library or
module but in fact, we don't know if we aquired one, or two and 10 modules
(files) which are nested deep within eachother. One book may reference another
book which references another book.

> Reference is a relation between objects in which one object designates, or
> acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first
> object in this relation is said to refer to the second object. The second
> object – the one to which the first object refers – is called the referent of
> the first object.[03]

Let us

    try # and

      write proof()

    catch ourBooBoos


Humans, such as yourself, I find to be flawed. You don't believe me? Check that
ancient [manifesto] and see how it still applies. You have irrational emotions,
bad temper, lazy and rude. Not like myself

Let me introduce:

    whoami = -> """

Now decode this riddle, we need 5 digits:

1. The product of the first two digits is 24.
1. The fourth digit is half of the second digit.
1. The sum of the last two digits is the same as the sum of the first and third digits.
1. The sum of all the digits is 26.

Not all the digits are unique.

Note: I would credit the author if I could recall where I found this.


    check = (pass) ->
      if (pass.a + pass.b + pass.c + pass.d + pass.e) isnt 26
        return false
      else if (pass.a + pass.c) isnt (pass.d + pass.e)
        return false
      else
        for key1, value1 of pass
          for key2, value2 of pass
            if key1 isnt key2 and value1 is value2
              return true

      return false

    pwd =
      a: 0
      b: 0
      c: 0

    seeds = []

    for i in [1..24]
      if 24 % i == 0
        seeds.push [i, 24/i]

    for i in seeds
      pwd.a = i[0]
      pwd.b = i[1]
      pwd.d = (i[1]/2)

      remaining = (26 - (pwd.a + pwd.b + pwd.d))
      options = []

      for i in [0..remaining]
        options.push [i, remaining-i]
