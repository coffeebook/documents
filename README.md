This repository contains several pieces of CoffeeScript in the literal form as
experimentation and demonstration of several concepts while I make up my mind
on how to process things such as:

* refereces
* footnotes
* inline code
* character encoding
* and so on

I use the Git Flow model for branching. Books will be inside lcs/book series.
Tests and such will be inside branches of the kind "test/something".
